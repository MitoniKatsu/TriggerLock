This was my semester project for my Case Study in Business Programming class at Seminole State College of Florida, and the final project for my Associates Degree in Software Engineering and Analysis. It is a Java program with an Oracle SQL database back-end.  I designed the program from start to finish, full SDLC, as well as the associated database.
